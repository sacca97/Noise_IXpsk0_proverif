			<h2>Message Pattern Analysis</h2>
			<p>Message <span class="mono">A</span> is the first message in the <span class="mono">IXpsk0</span> Noise Handshake Pattern. It is sent from the initiator to the responder. In this detailed analysis, we attempt to give you some insight into the protocol logic underlying this message. The insight given here does not fully extend down to fully illustrate the exact state transformations conducted by the formal model, but it does describe them at least informally in order to help illustrate how Message <span class="mono">A</span> affects the protocol.</p>
<h3>Sending Message <span class="mono">A</span></h3>
<p>In the applied pi calculus, the initiator's process prepares Message <span class="mono">A</span> using the following function:</p>
<p class="proverif">
letfun writeMessage_a(me:principal, them:principal, hs:handshakestate, payload:bitstring, sid:sessionid) =
	let (ss:symmetricstate, s:keypair, e:keypair, rs:key, re:key, psk:key, initiator:bool) = handshakestateunpack(hs) in
	let (ne:bitstring, ns:bitstring, ciphertext:bitstring) = (empty, empty, empty) in
	let ss = mixKeyAndHash(ss, psk) in
	let e = generate_keypair(key_e(me, them, sid)) in
	let ne = key2bit(getpublickey(e)) in
	let ss = mixHash(ss, ne) in
	let ss = mixKey(ss, getpublickey(e)) in
	let s = generate_keypair(key_s(me)) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, ns:bitstring) = encryptAndHash(ss, key2bit(getpublickey(s))) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, ciphertext:bitstring) = encryptAndHash(ss, payload) in
	let hs = handshakestatepack(ss, s, e, rs, re, psk, initiator) in
	let message_buffer = concat3(ne, ns, ciphertext) in
	(hs, message_buffer).
</p>
<h4>How each token is processed by the initiator:</h4>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">psk</span>: Signals that the initiator is calculating a new session secret that adds a pre-shared symmetric key as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_a</span>:</li>
<li><ul>
<li> <span class="mono">mixKeyAndHash</span>, which mixes and hashes the PSK value into the state and then initializes a new state seeded by the result.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">e</span>: Signals that the initiator is sending a fresh ephemeral key share as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_a</span>:</li>
<li><ul>
<li><span class="mono">mixHash</span>, which hashes the new key into the session hash.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">s</span>: Signals that the initiator is sending a static key share as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">writeMessage_a</span>:</li>
<li><ul>
<li><span class="mono">encryptAndHash</span> is called on the static public key. If any prior Diffie-Hellman shared secret was established between the sender and the recipient, this allows the initiator to communicate their long-term identity with some degree of confidentiality.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
<p>Message <span class="code">A</span>'s payload, which is modeled as the output of the function <span class="mono">msg_a(initiatorIdentity, responderIdentity, sessionId)</span>, is encrypted as <span class="mono">ciphertext2</span>. This invokes the following operations:</p><ul>
<li><span class="mono">encryptAndHash</span>, which performs an authenticated encryption with added data (AEAD) on the payload, with the session hash as the added data (<span class="mono">encryptWithAd</span>) and <span class="mono">mixHash</span>, which hashes the encrypted payload into the next session hash.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Receiving Message <span class="mono">A</span></h3>
<p>In the applied pi calculus, the initiator's process prepares Message <span class="mono">A</span> using the following function:</p>
<p class="proverif">
letfun readMessage_a(me:principal, them:principal, hs:handshakestate, message:bitstring, sid:sessionid) =
	let (ss:symmetricstate, s:keypair, e:keypair, rs:key, re:key, psk:key, initiator:bool) = handshakestateunpack(hs) in
	let (ne:bitstring, ns:bitstring, ciphertext:bitstring) = deconcat3(message) in
	let valid1 = true in
	let ss = mixKeyAndHash(ss, psk) in
	let re = bit2key(ne) in
	let ss = mixHash(ss, key2bit(re)) in
	let ss = mixKey(ss, re) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, ne:bitstring, valid1:bool) = decryptAndHash(ss, ns) in
	let rs = bit2key(ne) in
	let (ss:symmetricstate, plaintext:bitstring, valid2:bool) = decryptAndHash(ss, ciphertext) in
	if ((valid1 && valid2) && (rs = getpublickey(generate_keypair(key_s(them))))) then (
		let hs = handshakestatepack(ss, s, e, rs, re, psk, initiator) in
		(hs, plaintext, true)
	).
</p>
<h4>How each token is processed by the responder:</h4>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">psk</span>: Signals that the responder is calculating a new session secret that adds a pre-shared symmetric key as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">readMessage_a</span>:</li>
<li><ul>
<li> <span class="mono">mixKeyAndHash</span>, which mixes and hashes the PSK value into the state and then initializes a new state seeded by the result.</li>

<li><span class="mono">mixHash</span>, which hashes the new key into the session hash.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">s</span>: Signals that the responder is receiving a static key share as part of this message. This token adds the following state transformations to <span class="mono">readMessage_a</span>:</li>

<p>Message <span class="code">A</span>'s payload, which is modeled as the output of the function <span class="mono">msg_a(initiatorIdentity, responderIdentity, sessionId)</span>, is encrypted as <span class="mono">ciphertext2</span>. This invokes the following operations:</p><ul>
<li><span class="mono">decryptAndHash</span>, which performs an authenticated decryption with added data (AEAD) on the payload, with the session hash as the added data (<span class="mono">decryptWithAd</span>) and <span class="mono">mixHash</span>, which hashes the encrypted payload into the next session hash.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Queries and Results</h3>
Message <span class="mono">A</span> is tested against four authentication queries and five confidentiality queries.
<h4>Authentication Grade 1: <span class="failed">Failed</span></h4>

<p>In this query, we test for <em>sender authentication</em> and <em>message integrity</em>. If Bob receives a valid message from Alice, then Alice must have sent that message to <em>someone</em>, or Alice had their static key and PSK compromised before the session began, or Bob had their static key and PSK compromised before the session began.</p>

<h4>Confidentiality Grade 1: <span class="failed">Failed</span></h4>
<p class="proverif"><br />RESULT attacker_p1(msg_a(alice,bob,sid_a)) ==> event(LeakS(px,bob)) && event(LeakPsk(py,alice,bob)) cannot be proved.</p>
